## What are Fake Nodes

Fake Nodes is a novel approach to numerical interpolation that aims to achieve a better interpolation without having to get new samples. You can use your samples as they were taken at better/more representative nodes, cheating with the interpolation domain by applying a map.

In the next notebooks, we will show the treatment of two classical phenomena in polynomial interpolation: the [Runge effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%27s_phenomenon) effect and the [Gibbs effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_phenomenon#Solutions) effect.
